I am currently a postdoctoral research fellow at Cornell University, with my research interests primarily focused on precision livestock farming and digital agriculture. In precision livestock farming, I am dedicated to monitoring animal health to enhance animal welfare. In digital agriculture, my work focuses on monitoring crop growth, including pest and disease detection, to improve crop yields and quality. By integrating drones, surveillance cameras, and various sensors with machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision, I aim to advance agricultural practices and reduce environmental impact.

I welcome collaborations with those who share similar research interests.
